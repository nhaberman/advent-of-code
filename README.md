# Advent of Code

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

I start most of my solutions in Powershell, and move on to c# for more complex puzzles.

### Input data

> Per the instructions on the Advent of Code site, I've excluded all input data from this repo.

In each day's folder, I create a file called `input-X.txt` to contain the day's input and `input-X-demo.txt` to contain the sample input.

Creating these data files locally should allow most solutions to work.

If I want any other test input, then I create a file called `input-X-xxxxxx.txt` for that case.
